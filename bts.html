<P>There's no doubt that all the BTS boys are super talented. They write and produce much of their own music and can boast that they're the first band since the Beatles to have three albums reach the number one spot in less than a year. Who's counting numbers, though? What really matters is that the Bangtan Boys work really hard at what they do. They do their best to deliver the absolute best to their fans.</P>
